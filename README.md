# Prototype Job Listing Page Design for Drupal
### A sample front-end page theme integrated to Drupal 8

## Introduction

The task is to import the HTML files and use it as a theme in Drupal 8. This is just an example on how quickly we can use an existing HTML page and show it in Drupal. However, this is not the complete and actual Drupal theming from scratch. The objective is to just showcase the possibility of using the template as the current theme in your Drupal installation.

## Instructions:

* Click "Clone or download" dropdown button to see the options
* You can either use Git or checkout with SVN using the web url, Open in Desktop (GithHub Desktop needs to be installed) or Download ZIP
* The quickest way is to download the zip file as we currently don't need a site and database configuration

* Copy and paste the extracted folder to your Drupal 8 /themes folder (assuming you have Drupal installed already)
* Login to your Drupal admin panel and navigate to the "Appearance" tab

* You might encounter error message while installing the theme, for now disregard and just save
* Navigate to the "Structure" tab and click "Block layout"
* Set all the blocks to "Region: None" or click "Disable" under Operations category on each block
